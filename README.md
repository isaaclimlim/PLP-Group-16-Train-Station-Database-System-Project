# PLP Group 16: Train Station Database System Project  

## Project Overview  
The Train Station Database System is designed to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of train station management. It provides a centralized solution for handling train schedules, passenger information, ticket bookings, and station resources while generating insights through analytics and reporting.  

This project is part of the **PLP Group 16** submission for our database systems coursework.  

## Features  
- **Train Schedule Management**: Manage train arrival and departure times seamlessly.  
- **Passenger Records**: Maintain comprehensive passenger data, including travel history and ticket information.  
- **Ticket Booking System**: Facilitate ticket purchases, cancellations, and payment processing.  
- **Resource Management**: Allocate station resources for efficient operations.  

## Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD)  
Our database design is based on a well-structured ERD that ensures data integrity and optimized relationships between entities.
